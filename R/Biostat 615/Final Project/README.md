## Biostat 615 Final Project

We wrote gradient descent algorithms to solve elastic net for linear and logistic regression. I've only included the code that I wrote.

### 1. grad_desc_vector: code for linear gradient descent with thresholding

### 2. universal_cv: code to find the best lambda for set of parameters and algorithms

### 3. universal_analysis: code analyzing performance of algorithms

### 4. Report: pdf with motivation, analysis, and interpretation of elastic net algorithms

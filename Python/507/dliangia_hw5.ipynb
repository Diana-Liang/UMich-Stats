For this is what your folk would call magic, I believe; though I do not understand clearly what they mean; and they seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy. But this, if you will, is the magic of Galadriel. Did you not say that you wished to see Elf-magic?' - Galadriel to Frodo and Sam, describing her Mirror. We call a string S magical if every substring of S appears in Galadriel's Mirror (under lateral inversion). In other words, a magical string is a string where every substring has its reverse in the string. Write a function __magical__, that takes a string S as its argument, determine if it is magical or not, and return the result: \"Yes\" is it is magical, or \"No\" if it is not magical. For example, magical('aba') is 'Yes'. Reason: the list of substrings are : a, b, ab, ba, aba. The reverse of each of these strings is present as a substring of S too. __Note:__ You don't need to worry about error checking for this question, but you are welcome to perform some appropriate error checking."

    " At each step, Johnny may swap two adjacent tiles if their sum is a prime number. Two tiles are considered adjacent if they have a common edge. Help Johnny to figure out whether the given 3-by-3 board can reach the goal state or not. Define a function __solve_puzzle__ that takes an 3-by-3 numpy array (i.e., an ndarray) as its only argument and returns Python Boolean that is True if and only if the given 3-by-3 board can reach the goal state. __Hint:__ You can start from the goal state, walk through all the possible states and save them into a global variable. You function just need to judge if the given state is inside the possible states or not."
